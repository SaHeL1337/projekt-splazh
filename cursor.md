4.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    *   **Structure:** Consider transitioning the Site Report page from a single `Collapse` to a more structured layout, potentially using a **Sidebar Menu** for issue categories and a main content area displaying **Tables** of affected URLs.
    *   **Top Summary:** Add a prominent summary card/section at the top of the Site Report showing key overall metrics (Total Pages, Total Issues by severity).
    *   **Visual Hierarchy & Layout:** Improve spacing, alignment, and overall structure using Tailwind CSS for a less sterile, more professional look inspired by established SEO tools.
    *   **Color & Icons:** Apply consistent color-coding for severity (e.g., red/orange for issues, green for success) and use icons effectively to enhance clarity in tables, sidebar, and summaries.
    *   **Visualizations (Optional):** Consider adding simple charts (e.g., Recharts pie/bar chart) to the Site Overview Report for things like status code distribution if time permits.
    *   **Consistency:** Ensure the visual style aligns with the updated landing page.
